Low Light Enhancement using MIRNet
This repository contains code for performing low-light image enhancement using the MIRNet architecture pretrained using Keras. Two versions of the same image were used for comparison: one with smaller pixel dimensions and another with larger pixel dimensions. The images were resized to 256x256 pixels before applying the enhancement.
